# Cyberrange

## Sujet du projet

I'm an IT specialist in a private company. I'd like to have a tool that allows me the ability to reproduce my company's infrastructure, in order to test how it will behave in case of attacks. Some of my infrastructure is externalized, which means that I have a Cloud provider that gives me some VM instances, and some of the services I have are hosted on my own resources. I've heard about a bunch of tools that do this kind of thing, named cyberrange, but I want my own because I think the price to pay is too high. The basic idea is to provide a copy of my network and declare some entry point, from which I will begin some pentests.
